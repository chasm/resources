###brief background on data structures

Data structures and how you store,process,acess data are integral part of programming.

#Stacks && Queues
In out data structure

##Stacks
LIFO - Last in first out
Insertion and deletion take part at one end of the stack.
Only take items and add items to the top of the stack.
Problems can occur when the stack is too big and you may not reach jobs at the bottom

###Operations
Stacks have three operations available
1.Push
2.Pop
3.Pip

##Queues
FIFO - first in first out
Takes jobs that have been in the Queue for the longest time.
Problems occur when important jobs may not get prioritised due to time being spent on trivial jobs.


##Linked lists
The tail of the front of the list points to the head of the next item.

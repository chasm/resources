# Teaching Resources

If time permits, as teachers prepare material for the day's lecture they can put their talking points, code examples, etc in this common repository. This way, the materials are kept forever and ever and can be reused, improved, and eventually turned into slides and videos.

This repository can also be used as storage for folx wanting to contribute lecture material, awesome code examples + pictures (frogs/dragons in tuxedos), suggestions for talking points, etc. If you have something that you think should be part of a certain lecture -- this is the place to put it. 

## How to Add Content
1. Choose one of the lectures in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i3ChRxQhFhFnA_N0G211zYJFsRh3dcgZAzrg4alVEpI/edit#gid=1309685217) that you would like to add content for. Create a new branch with the lecture name as its title.
2. On the new branch, create a folder with the lecture name as its title.
3. Add a link to that folder in the directory below.
4. In that folder, create the following:
  - a "lecture-notes.md" file, to put lecture-notes, talking points, etc. for the screencast
  - a "code-examples" subfolder to store code-examples for the screencast
  - a "media" subfolder to store diagrams, images, and any other relevant media for the screencast
5. Populate lecture-notes.md with talking points for the lecture.
6. Create code examples, and put them in the code-examples folder. Reference them in lecture-notes.md
7. If necessary, find or create media and put it in the media folder. Reference media in lecture-notes.md
8. Using all the above materials, create a new slide deck on [slides.com](slides.com). Login information can be found in the "teaching" chatroom on EDA's staff Slack account. Add a link to your slides in lecture-notes.md when you're finshed
9. Make a video, using all the above materials. When finished, add link to lecture-notes.md
